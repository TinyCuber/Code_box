Instructions for the Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game. At the start of the game, the program randomly generates an integer between 1 and 100 as the secret number. The player's task is to guess this secret number.
Each time the player enters a guessed number, the program will compare it with the secret number and give corresponding prompts:
If the number the player guessed is larger than the secret number, the program will prompt "Your guess is too high. Try again."
If the number the player guessed is smaller than the secret number, the program will prompt "Your guess is too low. Try again."
The player keeps guessing until they get the correct answer. When the player guesses correctly, the program will display "Congratulations! You guessed it right! You took [X] attempts in total.", where [X] is the total number of attempts the player made.
