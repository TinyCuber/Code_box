Introduce:
- These projects are some games and practicl tools. The main purpose is to show real-world project examples of programming languages. The languages are Python, Html, C++, and so on, mainly for relaxation. There is no need for too much complicated code, but mostly some easy-to-understand code.

Special things:
- It is more suitable for the classic gameplay, but it has been appropriately improved to make the gameplay richer and more interesting.
- Make the game interface more beautiful and clear than the original version, which is easy to operate.
- Multilingual, different functions, different effects, richer varieties, better user experience.

- 1.Pour into the database
- 2.Define functions to make the game effective
- 3.Execution function and main program
- Html:
- 1.Compile basic data
- 2.Calculate the special effects of each part through the code
- 3.Calculation of operations and results
