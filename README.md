## 🚩 Introduce:
- These projects are some games and practicl tools. The main purpose is to show real-world project examples of programming languages. The languages are Python, Html, C++, and so on, mainly for relaxation. There is no need for too much complicated code, but mostly some easy-to-understand code.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to download the project, just download the GitHub repository. Each item is in a folder, differentiated by programming language, and can be downloaded separately.

>[!TIP]
>The software is all in folders, and there is no need to download packages or distribution content.

## 💖 Special things:
- It is more suitable for the classic gameplay, but it has been appropriately improved to make the gameplay richer and more interesting.
- Make the game interface more beautiful and clear than the original version, which is easy to operate.
- Multilingual, different functions, different effects, richer varieties, better user experience.

## 📝 Projects structure:
### Python:
- 1.Pour into the database
- 2.Define functions to make the game effective
- 3.Execution function and main program
### Html:
- 1.Compile basic data
- 2.Calculate the special effects of each part through the code
- 3.Calculation of operations and results

>[!TIP]
>Just an outline, it doesn't mean that all project structures are the same, there will be slight differences.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Please configure your own editor to run the file, because the project has many programming languages, and don't forget to inject the necessary operations such as the library (all projects in this repository are VSCode edits)

## ⬆️ Update Notes
>[!TIPS]
>This repository is not a large project, but multiple small projects, so only the updated project is stated

### Add JavaScript project
>[!TIPS]
>Both html and JavaScript are put in the web folder because they are both front-ends.

### Add C++ project

### Add Html project
>[!TIPS]
